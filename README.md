Universal tech radar with minimal configuration.

## Original
Thanks to thoughtworks!

A library that generates an interactive radar, inspired by [thoughtworks.com/radar](http://thoughtworks.com/radar).

## Why not original?
1. I need main page for multiple radars
2. I need strongly hardcoded private data
3. I need simple radar updates with merge data and without any other code
